How It Works
Task Filtering & Pagination Flow:

Tasks → Filter → Sort → Paginate → Display

Functionality:
When you first load a page, only 2 tasks are shown
Clicking "Load More" expands to show all tasks for that page (up to 10)
Navigating to a new page resets to showing just 2 tasks initially
All filtering and sorting happens before pagination

Versatile Configuration:
initialDisplayCount: Controls how many items to show initially (default: 2)
itemsPerPage: Maximum items per page (set to 10 in Dashboard)
showLoadMore: Toggle for "Load More" functionality
